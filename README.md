# Determining-Potential-Readers-For-a-Target-Book
The project aims to find potential readers for a specific book. It presents stakeholders as publishing houses or bookstores. It takes into account the preferences of the users based on the books that they have read and reviewed, defined here on as user-book interaction. The user is defined as the main agent. In our problem statement, given user-book interaction data, potential users are ascertained for a target book. The supplemental objective here is to understand which users are more likely to buy the “new” book, given their likes, dislikes, past reading history, and their reviews/ratings on those books. The project’s aim is to use a similarity score between the “target” book and the books read/liked by the users and present a group of users who are the target readers for that specific book.
